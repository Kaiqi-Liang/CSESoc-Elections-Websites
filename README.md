* I ran for Arc Delegate in 2019 but lost.
This is the [webiste](http://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~z5210932/elections/2019) I created and it was after the term when I first learnt JavaScript.


* I ran for Arc Delegate again in 2020 along with Grievance Officer and won the position of Arc Delegate for 2021.
This is the [website](http://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~z5210932/elections/2020) I made and it was during the term when I was taking a frontend course.
