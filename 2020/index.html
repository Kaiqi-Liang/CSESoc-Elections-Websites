            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <h3>CSE Revue Social Director</h3>
            <p>During the course of 2020 I have been involved with CSE Revue as the social director. Running events was challenging due to the COVID-19 situation, but the experience of working in an operational team has equipped me with the necessary responsibilities and management skills which I can project onto the positions of Arc Delegate and Grievance Officer;</p>
            <br>
            <h3>CSE Casual Tutor</h3>
            <p>Since 2019 I have been associated with several COMP courses whether that would be helping out students in a help session or lab assisting and tutoring a class. At the moment I am primarily a tutor for COMP1531 and COMP2511. It is through this 2 years of experience I have learnt how to interact with CSE students effectively and have developed great leadership skills;</p>
            <br>
            <h3>CSESoc Involvement</h3>
            <p>If you can't tell already I have devoted a majority of my spare time to CSE and only CSE. Why? Because I absolutely love this community and I want to give back everything they've given to me. Another example of this was when I was a peer mentor for CSESoc, and a part of the Media Subcommittee in 2019 (Hosted 3 episodes on the CSESoc Podcast Echo);</p>
